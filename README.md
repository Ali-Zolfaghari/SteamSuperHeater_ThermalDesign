# SteamSuperHeater_ThermalDesign
Steam super heaters are widely used in steam generators and heat-recovery steam generators (HRSGs). Their purpose is to raise steam temperature  from saturation conditions to the desired final temperature, which can be as high as 1,000Â°F in some  cases. When used in steam turbines, superheated steam decreases steam heat rate of the turbine and thus improves the turbine and overall plant power output and efficiency. Also, steam conditions at the  steam turbine exit will have little or no moisture, depending on the pressure ratio; moisture in the last  few stages of a steam turbine can damage the turbine  blades. This article outlines some of the design considerations and performance aspects of super heaters, which should be of interest to plant engineers.
