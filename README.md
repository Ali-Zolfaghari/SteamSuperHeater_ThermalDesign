# SteamSuperHeater_ThermalDesign
Steam super heaters are widely used in steam generators and heat-recovery steam generators (HRSGs). Their purpose is to raise steam temperature  from saturation conditions to the desired final temperature, which can be as high as 1,000Â°F in some  cases.
- This code coupled with refprop software to caculate gas properties. (so need to install refprop and coupled it with MATLAB : https://trc.nist.gov/refprop/LINKING/Linking.htm)
- Thermal Design of a Steam Super Heater based on HTRI.
